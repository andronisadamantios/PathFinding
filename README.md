# PathFinding
PathFinding algorithms implementaion on 2 dimensional grid
## 3 pathfinding algorithms
  1. Best-first-search
  2. Breadth-first-search
  3. A*

## Grid Topology
  - The grid sides can wrap. Both top-bottom and left-right. Torus interconnect.
  - The type of cell Moore neighbourhood can change (adjacent and/or diagonal tiles).
